          Estimate this figure if your accounts are not yet complete.

          Your estimate should be realistic and reasonable. Base it on your profit for the year so far and previous years, your business plan and any seasonal variation or future work you expect.

          Keep notes to show how you made your estimate. We may need to check this with you.
