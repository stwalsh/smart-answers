Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the reduced rate of £14.00 per week.

This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.

Depending on how child maintenance is arranged, fees may be added to this amount.

Payment type | Weekly payment | Fees | Total amount you’ll receive | Application fee  - you only pay this once

[Direct pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £14.00 | No fees | £14.00 | £20.00
[Arranging child maintenance yourself](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself) | £14.00 | No fees | £14.00 | No fee

You will pay up to £29.12 in fees per year if you receive child maintenance through the Collect and Pay service.
