You must report your lost or stolen passport to Her Majesty's Passport Office.

To report your lost passport you can do any of:

- [download a copy of form LS01](/government/publications/report-a-lost-or-stolen-passport-form-ls01) and post the completed form to Her Majesty's Passport Office - the address is on the form
- get a copy of form LS01 from a Post Office that offers the [Check and Send service](/how-the-post-office-check-and-send-service-works)
- use the new [online service](https://www.loststolenpassport.service.gov.uk/report) - this service is [in beta](/help/beta)

^You’ll need a daytime telephone number and either an email address or UK mobile number to use the online service.^

%Your signature will be compared to the signature on the original passport application form. If the original application was made by someone else, you’ll also need to send a signed letter from that person confirming that the passport has been lost or stolen. This is to help prevent child abduction.%

You can use the [online enquiry form](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/Passport_Enquiries.ofml) to contact Her Majesty’s Passport Office for general advice.

##Replacing your passport

You can apply for a replacement at the same time if you’re a British national and in the UK.

Follow the same process as [renewing a passport](/renew-adult-passport) but you must send a completed form LS01 with your application (if you haven’t already reported it as lost)

^Use the [online enquiry form](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/Passport_Enquiries.ofml) to contact Her Majesty’s Passport Office for general advice.

% You can’t use the [1-day Premium service](/get-a-passport-urgently) if you’re replacing a lost passport. %

##If you find your passport

If you find your passport, don’t sign the form. Instead, return the form in the envelope provided with a signed note confirming that you have found your passport and don’t want to cancel it.
