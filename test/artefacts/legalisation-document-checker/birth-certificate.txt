##Birth certificate
Your birth certificate can be legalised if it is either:

- an official certified copy of the certificate issued by the General Register Office (GRO) with the original seal
- an original certificate (or original certified copy) issued by a local register office, with the original signature of the official who issued the certificate

It can take longer to legalise a signature on an original certificate, especially if it was issued before 1991.

It might be quicker to order a certified copy of your certificate from the:

- [GRO (England and Wales)](https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/default.asp)
- [GRO for Scotland](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/contacts/opentime/index.html/)
- [General Register Office for Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/general-register-office-for-northern-ireland)
