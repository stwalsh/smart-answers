##Marriage certificate

Your marriage certificate can be legalised if it’s either:

- an official certified copy of the certificate issued by the General Register Office (GRO) with the original seal

- an original certificate (or original certified copy) issued by a church, religious establishment or local register office, with the original signature of the official who issued the certificate

It can take longer to legalise a signature on an original certificate, especially if it was issued before 1991.

It might be quicker to order a certified copy of your certificate from the:

- [GRO (England and Wales)](https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/default.asp)
- [GRO for Scotland](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/contacts/opentime/index.html/)
- [General Register Office for Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/order-life-event-certificates/order-a-marriage-certificate.htm)

^Non-GRO marriage certificates (eg Islamic marriage certificates) can't be legalised unless they are certified.^

^A photocopy of your document won’t be accepted.^

##Certifying documents

If you provide a certified document, it must be certified in the UK by a solicitor or ‘notary public’.

When the solicitor or notary public signs the document, they must:

- note the type of certification they have done (eg the document is a true copy of the original)
- use their personal signature, not a company signature
- include the date of certification
- include their company address

If they add a notarial certificate, it must be attached to the document. The certificate must also  contain a specific reference to the document they have certified.

If a notary public from England, Wales or Northern Ireland signs a document for legalisation, they must also stamp or emboss the document with their notarial seal.
