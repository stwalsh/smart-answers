$!You must register the death according to the regulations in the country where the person died. You will be given a local death certificate.$!

This local death certificate will be accepted in the UK. It may need to be a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document) of the document if it’s not in English.

##Register the death with the UK authorities

You can also apply to register the death with the UK authorities. You don’t have to do this, but it means:

- the death will be recorded with the General Register Offices (for England, Wales and Northern Ireland) and the National Records Office of Scotland
- you can order a consular death registration certificate

You will need to:

s1. Check that you have the right documents.
s2. Print out and fill in the forms.
s3. Pay.
s4. Post your documents and the forms.

###1. Documents

^Send English translations of all foreign documents. Use a professional translator and include their name and address with your application. Don't send laminated documents.^

You must provide:

- the original local death certificate (not a certificate issued by a doctor)

- a photocopy of the photo page of the passport of the person who died
- their original full UK birth, naturalisation or registration certificate (if you can’t provide their passport)
- written permission from the person’s next of kin or the executor of their estate (if you’re not next of kin or the executor)

%Your application will be rejected if the documents aren’t authentic, don’t confirm the person’s identity or don’t prove that they were a British national when they died. The registration fee won’t be refunded.%

###2. Forms

Print out and fill in the [death registration form](/government/publications/application-to-register-an-overseas-death).

###3. Pay
