##Return of your documents

* at least 12 weeks if the child doesn’t have a British passport
* 5 working days if the child has a British passport

The Overseas Registration Unit will contact you if they need more information or if they need to verify your documents. If this happens then it could take longer for the birth to be registered.

Your documents will be returned to you by secure courier after the birth has been registered. You’ll also be sent copies of the registration certificate if you’ve paid for them.
