$!You must register the birth in the country where the child was born. You'll be given a local birth certificate.$!

You can also register the birth with the UK authorities.

^It’s usually quicker to register the birth with the UK authorities if you [get a British passport](/overseas-passports) for the child first. You can’t apply for a passport in Libya but you can apply in a neighbouring country.^

To register the birth with the UK authorities you must:

s1. Check that you have the right documents.
s2. Print out and fill in the birth registration form.
s3. Pay.
s4. Post your documents and the form.

##1. Check your documents

^Send English translations of all foreign documents. Use a professional translator and include their name and address with your application. Don't send laminated documents.^

You must send the original copies of:

- the child’s full local birth certificate - it must have both parents’ names
- the hospital live birth certificate

- the long version of the parent’s birth certificate showing the child’s grandparents’ details (for parents who were born in the UK)
- the parent’s naturalisation or registration certificate (for parents who weren’t born in the UK)
- the parents’ marriage or civil partnership certificate (if applicable)
- evidence that the parents’ previous marriages or civil partnerships have ended (eg divorce or death certificates)
- change of name documents (if either parent has ever changed their name)
- a letter from the parent’s employer if they’re working abroad as a UK civil servant, EU civil servant, diplomat or member of HM Forces (for British parents)
- written evidence if the parent was born overseas while one of their own parents was working abroad as a UK civil servant, EU civil servant, diplomat or member of HM Forces (for British parents)

You must also send photocopies of:

- the photo page of the child’s British passport if they have one
- the photo page of the parent’s current passport (for British parents)
- the birth certificate or the photo page of the parent’s current passport (for parents who aren’t British)

If the child doesn't have a British passport you must also send the original copies of:

- the mother’s antenatal, postnatal and delivery notes from the hospital (eg blood test results, ultrasound scans and doctors' notes) or copies certified by the hospital if you can't get the originals
- health cards from the hospital, doctor or clinic
- immunisation and vaccination cards
- a letter from the hospital confirming the birth
- receipts from the hospital for the birth and any medical treatment (if any)
- photos of the child as a baby, in which the child can clearly be identified with its parents in Sierra Leone
- photos of the child growing up in Sierra Leone with its parents and any siblings
- the parents' wedding photos (if the parents have been married)
- photos of the mother during pregnancy (if the mother is a British citizen)

%Your application will be rejected if the documents aren’t authentic, don’t confirm the child’s identity or don’t prove that the child has a claim to British nationality. The registration fee won’t be refunded.%

* 5 working days if the child has a British passport

The Overseas Registration Unit will contact you if they need more information or if they need to verify your documents. If this happens then it could take longer for the birth to be registered.

Your documents will be returned to you by secure courier after the birth has been registered. You’ll also be sent copies of the registration certificate if you’ve paid for them.
