Marriage in the United Arab Emirates


Contact the [Embassy of the United Arab Emirates](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for the United Arab Emirates](/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates) before making any plans.

^There are no civil marriages in the United Arab Emirates, but you can get married through a religious ceremony at a church or Sharia court.^

You may be able to get married at the British Embassy if you’re both resident in the United Arab Emirates and can prove that there are no other suitable facilities.

Contact the British Embassy in the United Arab Emirates for more information.

##What you need to do

You need to have been living in the country where you intend to marry for 21 days.

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in the United Arab Emirates to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

###Legalisation and translation

You might need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

##Fees

Service | Fee

You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.
