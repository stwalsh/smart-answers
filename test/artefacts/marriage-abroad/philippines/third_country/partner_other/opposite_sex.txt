Marriage in the Philippines


Contact the relevant local authorities in the Philippines to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for the Philippines](/foreign-travel-advice/philippines) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Contact the British embassy or consulate in the Philippines to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Manila.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-manila/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- equivalent documents for your partner

###Legalisation and translation

You might need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

The embassy will provide you with an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry. You can print and fill in (but not sign) the [affidavit/affirmation for marriage form](/government/publications/marriage-in-the-philippines) in advance - it must fit on one page.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) - you’ll need to get the document [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English (bring the original and English translation with you)
- the original marriage certificate, Advisory of Marriage and court documents (if the previous marriage was annulled in the Philippines)
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

You must bring photocopies of all your supporting documents.

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
