Marriage in India


Contact the relevant local authorities in India to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

The British High Commission in India can provide you with a letter explaining this position for a charge - see [consular fees for India](/government/publications/india-consular-fees).
