- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/jordan/uk/partner_other/opposite_sex)
- [go to Jordan and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/jordan/ceremony_country/partner_other/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Jordan, you’ll normally have to wait at least 10 days before you can get married.%
