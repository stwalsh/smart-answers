Marriage in Germany

Contact the relevant local authorities in Germany to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You don’t need a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry if you’re a British national resident outside of the UK. However, you’ll need to apply for an exemption (‘Befreiung von der Beibringung des Ehefähigkeitszeugnisses’).

The local registry office (‘Standesamt’) where you’re getting married should tell you what to do.

If the Standesamt does ask you for a CNI (‘Ehefähigkeitszeugnis’), refer them to the relevant part of the [German Civil Code](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1309.html) (‘Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch’). This is published on the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court (‘Oberlandesgericht’) website, but it applies to the whole of Germany.

Check with the Higher Regional Court where you’re getting married if they don’t accept this.

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^
