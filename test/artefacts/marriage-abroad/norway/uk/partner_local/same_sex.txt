Civil Partnership in Norway

Same-sex relationships in Norway that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:

- marriage
- ’registrert partnerskap’, or ’registered partnership’.

Contact the [Embassy of Norway](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Norway](/foreign-travel-advice/norway) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy in Oslo to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport, a copy of your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

^Your partner will need to get an affirmation as well.^

###Legalisation and translation

You might need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
