Marriage in Spain

Contact the relevant local authorities in Spain to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

Civil weddings in Spain take place at a town hall, register office or district court. You must register with the local civil authorities afterwards to get an official marriage certificate if you have a religious wedding.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You'll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI), marital status certificate or both to prove you’re allowed to marry.

##Other requirements for Spain

If you’ve been living in Spain for less than 2 years, the civil registrar may also ask for confirmation of your addresses for the past 2 years (‘confirmación de domicilio para casarse en España’).

You’ll need to show one of the following:

- a letter confirming your address, eg electoral roll
- a bank or building society statement, credit card statement
- a mortgage statement
- a council tax letter
- utility bills
- recent proof of entitlement to local or state benefits, eg tax credits, pension, education or other benefits

If you’re asked to provide a document from the British consulate, print out a copy of the [‘communication proof of address’](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/288272/Communication_re_Proof_of_Address.pdf).

^You must get your documents translated if they’re not in English or Spanish.^

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
