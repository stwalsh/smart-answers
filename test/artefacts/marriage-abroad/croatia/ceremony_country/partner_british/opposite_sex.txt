Marriage in Croatia

Contact the relevant local authorities in Croatia to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You'll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

The local registrar may also need a certificate of custom and law, which confirms the marriage is valid - the Embassy in Zagreb can provide this.

###Applying for a CNI from the embassy

You’ll need to have been living in Croatia for 3 full days before you can post notice, eg if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

You can then book an appointment at the embassy to give notice of your marriage. There’s a fee for this service (read the table on this page).

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Zagreb.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-zagreb/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy or notary public to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.^

You’ll need to fill in forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

###What happens next

The embassy or notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath.

If you give notice at a notary public, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to your nearest British embassy or consulate afterwards.

^The embassy or consulate may charge a fee to return your documents to you.^

The consulate will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

They’ll then send all of your documentation to the British embassy or consulate nearest to where you’re getting married in Croatia, who will issue your CNI (as long as nobody has registered an objection).

There’s an additional fee for this - the embassy or consulate will contact you to arrange payment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Croatia.

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^
