Civil partnership in Switzerland


Same-sex relationships in Switzerland that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ’eingetragene Partnerschaft’, ’partenariat enregistré’, ’unione domestica registrata’ or ’partenadi registrà’ (’registered partnership’).

Contact the Civil Register Office where you’re entering into a civil partnership to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.
