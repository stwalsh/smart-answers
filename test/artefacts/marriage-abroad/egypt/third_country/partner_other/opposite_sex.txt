Marriage in Egypt


Contact the relevant local authorities in Egypt to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Egypt](/foreign-travel-advice/egypt) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Egypt to make a declaration that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Cairo.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-cairo/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- a valid Egyptian visa
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate) which states both of your parents’ names
- equivalent documents for your partner

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^
