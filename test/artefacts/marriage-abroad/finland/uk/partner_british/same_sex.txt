Civil partnership in Finland

Same-sex relationships in Finland that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ’rekisteröity parisuhde’, or ’registrerad partnerskap’ (’registered partnership’).

Contact the [Embassy of Finland](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You should also check the [travel advice for Finland](/foreign-travel-advice/finland).

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Finland.

Contact the local British embassy or consulate where you’re planning the ceremony to find out what you need to do.
