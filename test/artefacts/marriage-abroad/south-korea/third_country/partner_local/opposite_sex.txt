Marriage in South Korea


Contact the relevant local authorities in South Korea to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for South Korea](/foreign-travel-advice/south-korea) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy in South Korea to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport, your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Seoul.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-seoul/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)

You’ll need to fill in an [‘Affidavit for Marriage’](/government/publications/south-korea-affidavit-of-eligibility-for-marriage-form) form stating that you’re free to marry. You can download and fill in (but not sign) the form in advance. You’ll need to take the form with you to your appointment.

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- you partner’s Family Relationship Certificate and Marriage Status Certificate - these can be obtained from a local district office anywhere in South Korea and must be translated into English and notarised by a lawyer in Korea
- your partner’s valid Korean ID card
- your partner’s proof of termination of any prior marriage(s)

###Legalisation and translation

You might need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) - a [decree nisi](/divorce/apply-for-decree-nisi) won’t be accepted

- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
