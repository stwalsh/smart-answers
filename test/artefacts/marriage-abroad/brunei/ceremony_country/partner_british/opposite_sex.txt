Marriage in Brunei


Contact the relevant local authorities in Brunei to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

^You must get married through an Islamic ceremony in Brunei if you or your partner is a Muslim. Otherwise, you’ll need to have a civil marriage.^
