Marriage in American Samoa

Contact the relevant local authorities in American Samoa to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

There aren’t any British consular facilities to register a marriage or get legal documents to prove you’re eligible to marry in American Samoa.

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for American Samoa](/government/publications/american-samoa-consular-fees).

You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.
