Marriage in China


Contact the relevant local authorities in China to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for China](/foreign-travel-advice/china) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

Make an appointment at your local British embassy or consulate in China to swear an affirmation/affadavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation or affidavit as well.^
