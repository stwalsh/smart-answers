Marriage in Monaco



Contact the relevant local authorities to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

There isn’t a British Embassy in Monaco. Contact the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris) for help with getting married in Monaco.

If you’re not in Monaco, [your closest Monegasque embassy](http://en.gouv.mc/Policy-Practice/Monaco-Worldwide/Diplomacy-and-International-Presence/bilateral-relations/All-the-countries) may be able to give you advice, or give you the contact details of the relevant local authorities.

^You should get legal advice before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re getting married in Monaco. You can get one of these from the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris).

You should check with the relevant local authorities in the town where you’re getting married to find out if you need one. Either you or your partner will need to have been resident there for 40 days before the ceremony.

Some local authorities only issue a certificate of custom law less than 6 months before the date of marriage. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

^You’ll need to have a civil ceremony first if you’re getting married in a religious ceremony.^

###The certificate of celibacy

The local authority might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not married or in a civil partnership. There’s no equivalent to this document in British law, so you’ll need to download the official note which explains this and take it with you instead.

##Naturalisation of your foreign partner if they move to the UK
