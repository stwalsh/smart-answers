Civil partnership in Luxembourg

Same-sex relationships in Luxembourg that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ’partenariat enregistré’, or ’eingetragene partnerschaft’ (’registered partnership’).

Contact the [Embassy of Luxembourg](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You should also check the [travel advice for Luxembourg](/foreign-travel-advice/luxembourg).

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Luxembourg.

Contact the local British embassy or consulate where you’re planning the ceremony to find out what you need to do.
