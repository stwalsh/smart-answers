Civil partnership in Austria

Same-sex relationships in Austria that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ‘eingetragene Partnerschaft’, or ‘registered partnership’.

Contact the relevant local authorities in Austria to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Austria.

Contact the local British embassy or consulate where you’re planning the ceremony to find out what you need to do.
