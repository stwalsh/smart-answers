Marriage in Japan

Contact your [nearest embassy or consulate](http://www.mofa.go.jp/about/emb_cons/over/index.html) of Japan to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/publications/japan-list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Japan](/foreign-travel-advice/japan) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in Japan. You can do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public.

##Giving notice of marriage

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport, showing that you’ve been in Japan for at least 3 days (if you’ve been outside of Japan for a short period and recently returned, a residence visa is normally acceptable)
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
- evidence of parental consent if you’re below the age you can legally get married without consent in the country you’re from (eg 18 in England and Wales)
- equivalent documents for your partner

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.^

You’ll need to fill in forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

###What happens next

The embassy or notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath.

If you give notice at a notary public, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to your nearest British embassy or consulate afterwards.

^The embassy or consulate may charge a fee to return your documents to you.^

The consulate will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

They’ll then send all of your documentation to the British embassy or consulate nearest to where you’re getting married in Japan, who will issue your CNI (as long as nobody has registered an objection).

There’s an additional fee for this - the embassy or consulate will contact you to arrange payment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Japan.

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^
