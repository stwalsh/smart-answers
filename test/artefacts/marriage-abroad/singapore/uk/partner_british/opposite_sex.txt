Marriage in Singapore


Contact the [High Commission of Singapore](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Singapore](/foreign-travel-advice/singapore) before making any plans.

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

However, you can swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry in front of a local [notary public or commissioner of oaths](http://www.conp.sg/co-np-directory-listing).
