Marriage in Belgium


Contact the relevant local authorities in Belgium to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Belgium to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

[Make an appointment at the British embassy in Brussels.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-brussels/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)

You’ll need to complete an ‘Affirmation for marriage’ (non-religious) form or an ‘Affidavit for marriage’ (religious) form in English.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

^Your partner will need to get an affirmation as well.^

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

Read the guidance on the [documents that you’ll need](/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-belgium#proof-of-address-and-identity).

###Legalisation and translation

You might need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
