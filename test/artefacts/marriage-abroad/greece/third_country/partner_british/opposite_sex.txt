Marriage in Greece

Contact the relevant local authorities in Greece (the town hall or the local priest) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Greece](/foreign-travel-advice/greece) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/greece/uk/partner_british/opposite_sex)
- [go to Greece and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/greece/ceremony_country/partner_british/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Greece, you’ll normally have to wait at least 14 days before you can apply to get married.%
