Marriage in Zimbabwe


Contact the [Zimbabwean Embassy in the UK](http://www.zimlondon.gov.zw/index.php/contact-us) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Zimbabwe](/foreign-travel-advice/zimbabwe) before making any plans.

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Zimbabwe. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.
