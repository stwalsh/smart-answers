Marriage in South Africa


Contact the [High Commission of South Africa](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for South Africa](/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa) before making any plans.

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

%You’ll probably be asked for a CNI if you want to marry a South African citizen in South Africa. You’ll need to ask if there are any other documents the authorities will accept instead.%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
