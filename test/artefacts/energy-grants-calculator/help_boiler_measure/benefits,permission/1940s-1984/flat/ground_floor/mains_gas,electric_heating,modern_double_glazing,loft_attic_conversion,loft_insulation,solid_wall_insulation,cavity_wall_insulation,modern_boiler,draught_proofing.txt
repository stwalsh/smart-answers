Under the Green Deal you could get some of these improvements without having to pay all the cost upfront:

###Boilers and insulation

- [Cavity wall insulation](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Insulation/Cavity-wall-insulation)

- [Solid Wall insulation](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Insulation/Solid-wall-insulation)

- Room in roof insulation

- [Under-floor insulation](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Insulation/Floor-insulation)

###Heating

- Better heating controls (eg room thermostats)

If your home is well insulated you could also qualify for money towards a [renewable heating system](/renewable-heat-premium-payment) and get paid for [generating your own electricity](/feed-in-tariffs).
