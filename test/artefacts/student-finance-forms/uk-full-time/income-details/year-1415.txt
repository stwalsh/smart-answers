Parents and partners - forms


Some student finance (eg a Maintenance Grant) is based on income.

You must send your income details for the 2012 to 2013 tax year. Do this online as part of the student's [online application](/apply-online-for-student-finance). If you can't do it online, use form PFF2.

If you think your income has dropped by 15% or more since the 2012 to 2013 tax year youâ€™ll need to do both of the following:

+ submit your 2012 to 2013 income details online or using form PFF2
+ complete a CYI form (to ask for the student finance to be based on your expected 2014 to 2015 tax year income)
