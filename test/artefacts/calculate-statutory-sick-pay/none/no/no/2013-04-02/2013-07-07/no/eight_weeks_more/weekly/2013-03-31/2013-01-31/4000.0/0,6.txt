##Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)

Your employee is entitled to SSP for 25 days out of 28 working days taken off sick between  2 April 2013 and  7 July 2013

You don’t have to pay until your employee tells you that they’re ill. You’ll have to pay any withheld amounts by the end of your employee's entitlement to sick pay if your employee is sick for more than 28 weeks.
