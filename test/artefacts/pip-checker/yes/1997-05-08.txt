$!Some people in England, Scotland and Wales have been invited to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

If you're still getting Disability Living Allowance (DLA), when you'll be invited to claim PIP depends on:

- when your DLA ends
- your postcode area
- if your care and mobility needs change

###Your DLA ends before September 2017

You'll be told 20 weeks before your DLA ends and invited to claim PIP in most areas.

You'll also be invited to claim PIP if you tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that your care or mobility needs have changed.
