You may be able to claim tax credits while you're abroad.

##Working Tax Credit

- live in Switzerland or an [European Economic Area](/eu-eea) (EEA) country and travel to the UK to work
- travel abroad to work, but are â€˜ordinarily resident' in the UK

^Ordinarily resident means you normally live in the UK, and plan to stay for the time being.^

- you are ordinarily resident in the UK
- you work in the UK and pay [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance) here
