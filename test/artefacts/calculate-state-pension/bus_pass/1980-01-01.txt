Your bus pass age


The date you qualify for a bus pass depends on where you live:

- on 1 January 2048 in England
- when you turn 60 years old in [Scotland](http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/public-transport/concessionary-travel-people-aged-60-or-disability),[Wales](http://wales.gov.uk/topics/transport/public/concessionary/?lang=en),[Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/free-bus-travel-and-concessions)

The dates may be different in some areas, check with your council when you can [apply for a bus pass](/apply-for-elderly-person-bus-pass).
