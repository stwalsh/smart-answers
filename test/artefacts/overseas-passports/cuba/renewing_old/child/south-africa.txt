## How long it takes

Your application should take 6 weeks from when it’s received by Her Majesty’s Passport Office in the UK.

You may have to attend an interview.

Applications will take longer if:

- Her Majesty’s Passport Office needs to ask you for more information or documents
- the photographs you send are rejected

Don’t book travel until you have a valid passport. If you need to travel more urgently, you may be able to apply for an [Emergency Travel Document.](/emergency-travel-document)

## Cost

You’ll have to pay a fee for your passport and a courier fee of £23.01. The courier fee pays for your passport to be sent securely to the British Embassy, high commission or consulate where you applied for you to collect.

| Passport type | Passport fee | Total to pay (including courier fee) |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Child passport | £53.00 | £76.01 |

You must pay in cash using local currency - the prices above will be converted according to the exchange rate when you apply.
