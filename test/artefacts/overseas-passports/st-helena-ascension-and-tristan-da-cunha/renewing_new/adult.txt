## How long it takes

Your application will take **at least** 8 weeks from when it’s received by Her Majesty’s Passport Office in the UK.

You may have to attend an interview.

Applications will take longer if:

- Her Majesty’s Passport Office needs to ask you for more information or documents
- the photographs you send are rejected

Don’t book travel until you have a valid passport. If you need to travel more urgently, you may be able to apply for an [Emergency Travel Document.](/emergency-travel-document)

## Cost

You’ll have to pay a fee for your passport.

| Passport type | Passport fee |
|---------------|--------------|
| Adult standard 32-page passport | £83.00 |
| Adult jumbo 48-page passport | £91.00 |

You must pay in cash. In addition to the passport fee you’ll need to pay any local administration fees which apply from the office where you make your application.

## How to apply

1. Download the application form.
2. Use the ‘Applying for a passport if you’re outside the UK’ guidance notes to help you fill in the application form.
3. Include 2 identical new photos of you (or your child, if it’s a child passport application). [Follow the rules about passport photos](/photos-for-passports) or your application may be delayed.
4. Check which supporting documents you must submit with your application. You must get documents that aren’t in English - including documents showing an address - fully translated by a professional translator.
