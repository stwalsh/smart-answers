Your application will take **at least** 10 weeks from when it’s received by Her Majesty’s Passport Office in the UK.

You may have to attend an interview.

Applications will take longer if:

- Her Majesty’s Passport Office needs to ask you for more information or documents
- the photographs you send are rejected
